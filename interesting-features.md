# Interesting Features

## Swift

### [5.6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/247/whats-new-in-swift-5-6)
- **Introduce existential keyword `any`** to mark existential types
- **Type placeholders** which allow us to explicitly specify only some parts of a valueâ€™s type so that the remainder can be filled in using type inference.
- **CodingKeyRepresentable** protocol that allows dictionaries with keys that arenâ€™t a plain String or Int to be used as CodingKeys when converted to JSON. Even custom structs can be used as coding keys.
- **Unavailability condition** representing an inverted form of #available called #unavailable, which will run some code if an availability check fails.

### [5.5](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/233/whats-new-in-swift-5-5)
- **Async/Await:** can replace many completion handlers! Especially nested asynchronere function calls.
- **AsyncSequence Protocol:** very useful to e.g. load several objects from a backend and process them as they come in. Reverse geocoding of Locations, processing of locations, etc.
- **Codable synthesis for enums with associated values:** very complex JSON structures are creatable in a simple way
- **Tasks:** as a replacement for operations. Might be easier to handle. Plays perfectly with asynch/await
- **Extend property wrappers to function and closure parameters**
- [NotificationCenter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter) includes a new [AsyncSequence API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence) for receiving notifications using async/await. (74401384)
- A new Swift value type [AttributedString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/attributedstring) is now available with the same character-counting behavior as Swift string. It is fully localizable, and also includes support for Markdown, Codable, strongly typed attributes, and more. (27227292)

### [5.4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/228/whats-new-in-swift-5-4)
- **Improved implicit member syntax** (UIColor.red.cgcolor > .red.cgcolor)
- **Result builders** (can probably be used to auto-chain Operations ðŸŽ‰)
- **Swift Package Manager caches package dependencies** ([Swift Packages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66143815/xcode-12-5-spm-dependency-cache-location))
- Property wrappers are now supported for local variables
- Local functions now support overloading

### [5.3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/218/whats-new-in-swift-5-3)
- **Swift Package Manager gains binary dependencies, resources, and more**
- **Type-Based Program Entry Points (@main)**
- **multi trailing closures**
- **synthesized comparable for enum types**
- **enum cases as protocol witness**
- increased availability of self in closures
- Multi-pattern catch clauses

### [5.0](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/126/whats-new-in-swift-5-0)

## Alamofire

[Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%205.0%20Migration%20Guide.md#alamofire-50-migration-guide)

- **Decodable Responses:**Â responseDecodableÂ and theÂ DecodableResponseSerializerÂ now provide built-in support for parsingÂ DecodableÂ types from network responses using anyÂ DataDecoderÂ type.
- **Encodable Parameters:**Â Alamofire now supports and prefersÂ EncodableÂ types as parameters using theÂ ParameterEncoderÂ protocol, allowing fully type-safe representation of request parameters.
- **EventMonitorÂ Protocol:**Â EventMonitors allow access to Alamofireâ€™s internal events, making it far easier to observe specific actions through a requestâ€™s lifetime. This makes logging requests very easy.
- **CachedResponseHandlerÂ andÂ RedirectHandlerÂ Protocols:**Â Easy access and control over response caching and redirect behaviors, on both aÂ SessionÂ andÂ RequestÂ basis.
- **HTTPHeadersÂ Type:**Â Type safe access to common HTTP headers, with extensions toÂ URLRequest,Â HTTPURLResponse, andÂ URLSessionConfigurationÂ to allow setting the headers of those types using Alamofireâ€™s new type.
- **RetryPolicy:**Â AÂ RequestRetrierÂ with automatic support for retrying requests which failed due to a network or other system error, with customizable exponential backoff, retry limits, and other parameters.
- **Serializers** updated with more configuration options, including allowed **empty response** methods and codes, as well as theÂ **DataPreprocessor**Â protocol, to prepare the receivedÂ DataÂ for serialization (**get rid of the DataWrapper?!**).

## WWDC/iOS

- **App tracking controls and transparency:** Developers are now required to get your consent before tracking you, so you can choose which apps have permission to track. And see which apps you have given permission to track in Settings so you can change yourÂ preferences.
- **Approximate location:** A new setting lets you choose to share your approximate location, rather than your precise location, with anÂ app.
- **Upgrade to Sign in with Apple:** Developers can offer the option to upgrade existing app accounts to Sign in with Apple so users can enjoy improved privacy, security, and ease of use without setting up a newÂ account.
- **VoiceOver Recognition:** On-device intelligence recognizes key elements displayed on your screen to add VoiceOver support for app and web experiences that donâ€™t have accessibility support builtÂ in.
- **Menus**
